# Single page React App
### Features
- Allows user to type a message into the form and send it into the void
- Uses CSS to animate the text disappearing into the void

### Purpose
- Sometimes people need to vent, but sending that text message or making that post or reply on social media might not always be the best decision.
Instead type out your thoughts and send them into the void where they can never come back to haunt you!


### Work in Progress

### Planned Features
- Connect to backend and database to store a list of words thrown into the void and a count of each
- Optional login for user to track how many words they've thrown in and show if they throw in a word that hasn't been entered before
